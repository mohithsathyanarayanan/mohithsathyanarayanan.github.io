## Climate change’s nasty consequences, and few solutions

Hey there, Hope you are doing good. I am Mohith Sathyanarayanan. I am pursuing masters in computer science. This is my blog on climate change and how society as a whole could work to reverse it.

### Introduction
Climate change includes both global warmings driven by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases and the resulting large-scale shifts in weather patterns. Though there have been previous periods of climatic change since the mid-20th century humans have had an unprecedented impact on Earth’s climate system and caused change on a global scale.
This can mainly be attributed to the fact that Human settlements have constantly evolved from a simple collection of shacks to an increasingly power-hungry metropolis, which in the long turn were not sustainable.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mohithsathyanarayanan/mohithsathyanarayanan.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
