### Climate change’s nasty consequences, and few solutions

### About me
Hey there, Hope you are doing good. I am Mohith Sathyanarayanan. I am pursuing masters in computer science from IIIT-Bangalore. I am very passionate about using technolgy in finance, i have done a internship under professor  C.jagadish Reddy of Hyderabad School of Buisness on the application of Data Science to Portfolio analysis. I have also been a part of the app development team of UpConnectMe a social media startup. When not busy with assignments and academics i am usually reading novels(my present one being "Alchemist") or playing my keyboard. I have also been a part of greenpeace during my schooling years.Here I would like to talk about climate change and a few solutions I had in my mind.

### Introduction
Climate change includes both global warmings driven by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases and the resulting large-scale shifts in weather patterns. Though there have been previous periods of climatic change since the mid-20th century humans have had an unprecedented impact on Earth’s climate system and caused change on a global scale.

This can mainly be attributed to the fact that Human settlements have constantly evolved from a simple collection of shacks to an increasingly power-hungry metropolis, which in the long turn were not sustainable.


### Effects of climate change

since the start of the industrial revolution, we have seen an ever-growing rate of greenhouse gases emissions, which causes the temperatures around the globe to raise. 

This, in turn, has led to many adverse changes in the climate, some of them being shrinking polar ice caps, increasing the number of floods and typhoons, acid rains.

### Solutions

  The main ways to stop climate change are to pressure government and business to:

  1) Keep fossil fuels in the ground. Fossil fuels include coal, oil and gas – and the more that are extracted and burned, the worse climate change will get. All countries need to move their economies away from fossil fuels as soon as possible.

  2) Invest in renewable energy. Changing our main energy sources to clean and renewable energy is the best way to stop using fossil fuels. These include technologies like solar, wind, wave, tidal and geothermal power.
  
  3) Switch to sustainable transport. Petrol and diesel vehicles, planes and ships use fossil fuels. Reducing car use, switching to electric vehicles and minimising plane travel will not only help stop climate change, it will reduce air pollution too.
    
   4) Plastic is made from oil, and the process of extracting, refining and turning oil into plastic (or even polyester, for clothing) is surprisingly carbon-intense. It doesn’t break down quickly in nature so a lot of plastic is burned, which contributes to emissions. Demand for plastic is rising so quickly that creating and disposing of plastics will account for 17% of the global carbon budget by 2050 (this is the emissions count we need to stay within according to the Paris agreement).

### Conclusion

Managing the climate crisis is ery important for us. Moreover Mitigating this challange and passing on a habitatable Earth to future generations is the resposibitlity of everyone of us. for this to happen it is vital that there is contribution from every section of society. Hopefully we can start changing things around so that all may breathe,live and smile.
